# Teeny-Coal

![Teeny Coal Cover Image](https://imgur.com/zbghL2s.png)

This mod adds miniature versions of coal and charcoal, as well as tiny redstone, soul, and regular torches. Teeny sticks, redstone dust, and soul dust are added to keep the 1/9 ratio of crafting materials for the tiny torches.

Teeny coal and charcoal can smelt 1 item each. Teeny Redstone Torches have a light level of 4 and emit a level 7 redstone signal. Teeny Torches have a light level of 10. Teeny Soul Torches have a light level of 8, and they do not scare Piglins.

NEW in version 1.2.0: Energized Redstone Compatibility!

If [Energized Redstone]((https://github.com/Andrew6rant/Energized-Redstone)) is installed, Teeny Coal will add Teeny Energized Torches and Teeny Energized Redstone Dust.
